        <h1>World Cup Championship</h1>
      <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup">The 2014 FIFA World Cup</a> is the 20th FIFA World Cup, the tournament for the association football world championship, which will take place at several venues across Brazil. All world champion teams since the first World Cup in 1930 – Argentina, Brazil, England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Uruguay – have qualified for this competition. So we are going to witness a very strong battle.</p>
        <p>In March 2003, FIFA announced that the tournament would be held in South America for the first time since 1978, in line with its then-active policy of rotating the right to host the World Cup among different confederations.</p>
          <p>The tournament will begin on 12 June with a group stage and conclude on 13 July with the championship match. It is the second time that Brazil hosts the competition, <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_FIFA_World_Cup">the first being in 1950.</a>
The national teams of 31 countries will advance through qualification competitions to participate with the host nation Brazil in the final tournament. For the first time at a World Cup finals, match officials will use goal-line technology, as well as vanishing foam for free kicks.</p>

        <h1>Football for all and all for football</h1>
        <img src="img/president.jpg" style="width:170px;height:100px">
        <p>On 8 June 1998 Joseph S. Blatter (Switzerland) was elected as the successor to Dr. João Havelange (Brazil) as the <a href="http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/president/aboutpresident.html">Eighth FIFA President.</a> This victory at the 51st FIFA Ordinary Congress in Paris (France) elevated Joseph S. Blatter, who had already served FIFA in various positions for twenty-three years, onto the highest rang in international football. Joseph S. Blatter is one of the most versatile and experienced exponents of international sports diplomacy and is totally committed to serving football, FIFA and the youth of the world. <a href="http://www.olympic.org/ioc">The International Olympic Committee</a> acknowledged Mr Blatter's achievements by electing him as a new committee member (the 104th) at the 109th session in Seoul on 20 June.</p>
<p>As always there will be a strong and intense competition with fantastic performances and breathtaking moments. It is estimated that during the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the FIFA Fan Fest in the host cities in Brazil will receive 5 million people, and the country will receive over 1 million guests from 202 countries around the world.</p>
